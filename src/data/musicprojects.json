    "description": "A radical left-wing, anti-war project created after the demise of my previous, unsuccessful project. The music is a mix of thrash and groove metal, hardcore, and punk. The project remained largely unnoticed, but for me, it represented a step forward lyrically and production-wise. It also served as my way of reflecting on the world around me, preventing me from going crazy. The project was shut down and renamed War Tread, where I released just one demo recording with two tracks.",
